                    <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
                    <p>By accessing or using the Handover application and services, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service and all applicable laws and regulations. If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using or accessing this service.</p>

                    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
                    <p>Handover is a desktop application built with Tauri (Rust framework) that provides secure peer-to-peer file transfer and messaging capabilities. The service consists of:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Desktop Application:</strong> A cross-platform desktop app for Windows, macOS, and Linux built with Tauri, providing a native user interface for file transfers and messaging</li>
                        <li><strong>Backend Server (handover-backend):</strong> A Rust-based backend server that handles Google OAuth authentication, user presence management, friend/block list management, and WebRTC signaling</li>
                        <li><strong>Peer-to-Peer Architecture:</strong> Direct file transfers and messaging between users via WebRTC data channels. Files never pass through our servers.</li>
                        <li><strong>End-to-End Encryption:</strong> All P2P connections are encrypted using WebRTC's built-in DTLS-SRTP encryption</li>
                        <li><strong>Friend System:</strong> Add friends, manage friend requests, and block unwanted users</li>
                        <li><strong>Presence System:</strong> See which friends are online and available for file transfers</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="policy-section">
                    <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
                    <p>Handover uses Google OAuth for authentication. When you sign in with your Google account, you must ensure that your Google account information is accurate, complete, and current at all times.</p>
                    <p>You are responsible for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Maintaining the security of your Google account credentials</li>
                        <li>All activities that occur under your account in the Handover application</li>
                        <li>Immediately notifying us of any unauthorized use of your account</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You may not share your account with others or allow others to access your account. Failure to maintain account security may result in immediate termination of your account.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="policy-section">
                    <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
                    <p>You agree to use Handover only for lawful purposes. You are prohibited from:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Uploading, posting, or transmitting any content that is illegal, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, or otherwise objectionable</li>
                        <li>Violating any applicable local, state, national, or international law</li>
                        <li>Infringing upon or violating intellectual property rights or any other rights of others</li>
                        <li>Transmitting any malware, viruses, or any code of a destructive nature</li>
                        <li>Attempting to gain unauthorized access to the service, other accounts, or computer systems</li>
                        <li>Interfering with or disrupting the service or servers or networks connected to the service</li>

                    <h2>5. Content Ownership and Rights</h2>
                    <p>You retain all rights to any content you transfer through the Handover service. Due to our peer-to-peer architecture:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>No Server Storage:</strong> Files are transferred directly between users via WebRTC data channels. Our backend server (handover-backend) never receives, stores, or has access to your file contents.</li>
                        <li><strong>No License Required:</strong> Since files never pass through our servers, you do not grant us any license to your content. We only facilitate the P2P connection through WebRTC signaling.</li>
                        <li><strong>No Content Analysis:</strong> We do not and cannot access, view, scan, or analyze the content of your files or messages.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You are solely responsible for the content you transfer and share through Handover. Ensure you have the right to share any content you transfer to other users.</p>
